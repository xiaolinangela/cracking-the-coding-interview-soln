Question : No Test Tools: How would you load test a webpage without using any test toots? 
Answer: 
    Load testing helps to identify a web application's maximum operating capacity, as well as any
    bottlenecks that may interfere with its performance. 
    Metrics to use: response time, throughput, resource utilization, and maximum laod that the system
                    can bear
    In the absence of formal testing tools, we can simulate concurrent users by creating thousands
    of virtual users by writing a multi-threaded program with thousands of threads, where each threaded
    acts as a real-world user loading the page. For each user, we would programmatically measure
    resoinse time, date I/O, etc.
