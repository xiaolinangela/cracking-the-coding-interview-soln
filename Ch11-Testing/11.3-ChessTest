Question:  We have the following method used in a chess game: boolean canMoveTo(int x,
i n t y). This method is part of the Piece class and returns whether or not the piece can move to
position (x , y). Explain how you would test this method. 

Answer: Two primary type of tests: extreme and general case validation
Extreme:
    1.negative number
    2.x larger than the width
    3.y larger than the height
    4.a completely full board
    5.empty or nearly empty board
    6.far more black pieces than white
    7.far more white pieces than black

General: 
    for each piece a:
        for each other type of piece b (6types + empty space):
            for each direction d:
                create a board with piece a
                place piece b in direction d
                try to move - check return value
